I'm a freelance research software engineer, computational neuroscientist, and data scientist based in Berlin, Germany.

I recently completed my PhD at Imperial College London where I worked with <a href="https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Juan Álvaro Gallego</a>, and used data analysis and computational modeling to investigate how neural populations give rise to movement under uncertainty.

Before my PhD, I did my master's in computational neuroscience at the BCCN Berlin and my BSc in molecular bionics engineering at PPCU in Budapest.

I believe (neuro)science needs easy-to-use and reliable software tools, and I would like to help make that happen.\
