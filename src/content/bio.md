I'm a freelance research software engineer, computational neuroscientist, and data scientist based in Berlin, Germany.
<br>
I believe (neuro)science needs easy-to-use and reliable software tools.

Feel free to contact me if your lab needs help with data processing and analysis pipelines.

I recently completed my PhD at Imperial College London where I worked with [Juan Álvaro Gallego](https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk), and used data analysis and computational modeling to investigate how neural populations give rise to movement under uncertainty.

Before my PhD, I did my master's in computational neuroscience BCCN Berlin and my BSC in molecular bionics engineering at PPCU in Budapest.
