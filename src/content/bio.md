I'm a research software engineer, computational neuroscientist, and data scientist based in Berlin, Germany.

I recently defended my PhD at Imperial College London where I worked with [Juan Álvaro Gallego](https://beneuro.ic.ac.uk), and used data analysis and computational modeling to investigate how neural populations give rise to movement under uncertainty.

Before my PhD, I did my master's in computational neuroscience BCCN Berlin and my BSC in molecular bionics engineering at PPCU in Budapest.
